Web Development 
1. Introduction

Web development refers to the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It combines design, programming, databases, and server technologies to deliver functional, accessible, and visually appealing digital experiences. Modern web development plays a key role in business, communication, e-commerce, education, and digital transformation.

2. Core Components of Web Development
A. Front-End Development

Front-end development focuses on what users see and interact with. It includes:

HTML – forms the structure of web pages.

CSS – defines the presentation, layout, and styling.

JavaScript – adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.
Front-end developers ensure the UI is responsive, user-friendly, and visually consistent across devices.

B. Back-End Development

Back-end development supports the behind-the-scenes logic:

Servers handle requests.

Databases store and manage data.

Server-side languages (Node.js, PHP, Python, Java) process logic and communication.
This layer ensures security, performance, and reliable functioning of the application.

C. Full-Stack Development

Full-stack developers work on both the front end and back end.
They bridge the gap between user experience and system functionality, often using frameworks like React, Express, Laravel, or Django.

3. Key Tools and Technologies

Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue, Laravel, Django, Ruby on Rails

Version Control: Git & GitHub
